// The one classification the whole app agrees on: what needs you, then what's newly ready, then
// what's running, then everything else. Every mark reads it (the row wash, the chip dots, the
// summary line), kept in one place so no two surfaces can disagree about what needs you.
//
// It CLASSIFIES; it no longer places. No list is laid out by bucket any more: the dashboard and the
// pane switcher both keep every pane where it sits (ADR 0063), and a bucket only decides a mark.
//
// It puts each pane in a BUCKET and keeps the order the bridge sent inside it (see {@link triage}).
// The two timestamps the bridge keeps per pane (bridge/activity.ts) still decide one bucket:
//   lastActiveAt — when the agent last changed status
//   lastSeenAt   — when you last opened or drove it through Collie
// "settled since you last looked" is `lastActiveAt > lastSeenAt`, which is the Ready·unseen bucket.
